Programming assignment for web development candidates
You can choose any programming language and web development framework, database, and web server you like. The web application you need to build is a basic
 todo list application with the following requirements:

Users can view their todo list
Users can add, remove, modify and delete todo entries
Each todo entry includes a single line of text, due date and priority.
Users can assign priorities and due dates to the entries.
Users can sort todo lists using due date and priority.
Users can mark an entry as completed.
You don't need to spend time on UI/UX design, if you do, it will be a bonus.

Provide a RESTful API which will allow a third-party application to trigger actions on your app (same actions available in the app).

Provide authentication and authorization service for both the app and the API.

As complementary item to the last requirement, you should be able to create users in the system via an interface, eg a signup/register screen.
